# **Road Accident Prediction Using Machine Learning**

## **Overview**
This project aims to predict road accidents using machine learning techniques to enhance road safety. By analyzing historical accident data and incorporating factors such as weather conditions, traffic density, and road characteristics, the system predicts accident severity with high accuracy. The project leverages classification algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression to identify patterns and provide real-time risk assessments.

## **Features**
- **Data Collection & Processing:** Gathers real-time and historical accident data, including weather, traffic flow, and road conditions.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Utilizes Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression for accident prediction.
- **Prediction Engine:** Estimates accident likelihood and severity based on input data.
- **Web-Based Interface:** An interactive dashboard to display accident risk predictions.
- **Scalability & Real-Time Analysis:** Capable of handling large datasets and real-time inputs.

## **System Architecture**
1. **Data Collection** â€“ Aggregates accident reports, traffic data, and environmental conditions.
2. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Cleans data, handles missing values, and selects relevant features.
3. **Machine Learning Model Training** â€“ Implements classification algorithms to predict accident severity.
4. **Prediction & Visualization** â€“ Displays accident probability on a dashboard for user insights.

## **Installation & Usage**
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Train the model:
   ```sh
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. Run the web application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```
4. Access the interface via the browser to input data and receive accident risk predictions.

## **Future Enhancements**
- Integration with **IoT** for real-time accident detection.
- Improved accuracy using **Deep Learning** techniques.
- Deployment as a **mobile/web-based application** for accessibility.

## **Conclusion**
This project provides a data-driven approach to improving road safety by predicting accidents before they occur. It helps authorities, urban planners, and individuals take proactive measures to reduce accidents and manage traffic efficiently.
